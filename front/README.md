## Prerequisite Software

Please make sure you've installed the following before continuing:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

Please ensure your `node` is on at least version `12.10.0`. This can be checked by running:
```
node -v
```

## Setup 

Start by installing the required packages:
```
yarn
```

Once the needed packages are installed, run:
```
yarn build
```
This will build and optimise the packages.

Once that is finished run:
```
yarn start
```
This will spin up a local instance of the front end.
